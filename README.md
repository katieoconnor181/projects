This file contains my individual work for a modeling capstone project using a kaggle data set provided by the company Home Credit. 
The notebook focuses on performing EDA on the data set, including things such as exploring predictor values, imputing missing or NA values, hot-encoding categorical values, scaling, 
and more for better model interpretation. From there, I move into exploring multiple models with the aim of choosing the models that best predict the initial target variable.
These models aim to provide Home Credit with better modeling accuracy to be able to better predict if an individual is or is not likely to repay a loan on time, with the goal of allowing them to make better and more
informed business decisions and leaad to increased profit long term.
